## A dictionary containing headers and values that the front-end proxy uses to indicate HTTPS requests.
## These tell Gunicorn to set wsgi.url_scheme to https, so your application can tell that the request is secure.
## The dictionary should map upper-case header names to exact string values.
## The value comparisons are case-sensitive,
## unlike the header names, so make sure they’re exactly what your front-end proxy sends when handling HTTPS requests.
## It is important that your front-end proxy configuration ensures that
## the headers defined here can not be passed directly from the client.
## example:
## {'X-FORWARDED-PROTOCOL': 'ssl',
## 'X-FORWARDED-PROTO': 'https',
## 'X-FORWARDED-SSL': 'on'}
